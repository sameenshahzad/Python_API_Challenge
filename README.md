# Python_API_Challenge

## Weahter Py

Created a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. Used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code. Created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Latitude vs. Temperature
* Latitude vs. Humidity
* Latitude vs. Cloudiness
* Latitude vs. Wind Speed

## Vacation Py

Used the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to create map visualizations for the ideal Vacation location with a temperature higher than 22 degrees, Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s and Zero cloudiness
